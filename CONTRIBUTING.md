# Contributing to StupidoPrint

Thank you for your interest in contributing to StupidoPrint! This project aims to make printing accessible to everyone, especially those who find technology challenging.

## üéØ Project Philosophy

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:

- **Simplicity First**: Every feature should make printing easier, not more complex
- **Accessibility**: Design for users with limited technical knowledge - think of your sister ‚Åª^-^
- **Reliability**: The software should "just work" without configuration
- **Universal Design**: Consider users of all ages and technical abilities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasonschurawel/StupidioPrint.git
   cd StupidoPrint
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. **Configure Printer** (for testing if your printer is even accesible)
   ```bash
   ./config_printer.sh
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   make run-dev
   ```

### Development Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow the existing TypeScript/React patterns
- **Testing**: Test with real printers when possible
- **Documentation**: Update README for user-facing changes

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, printer model
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear, numbered steps
- **Expected vs Actual**: What should happen vs. what happens
- **Screenshots**: Especially helpful for UI issues
- **Log Output**: Include relevant console/server logs

## üí° Feature Requests

Before suggesting features, consider:

- **Will this make printing simpler for non-technical users?**
